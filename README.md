Im following the udacity developer tutorial sunshine.
Open completion id like to hope i could have this app compatible with the device im testing on a amlogic t95n tv box.
This device runs on a tablet rom not a tv one so ill be setting gui as a nexus 10" this worked well with the custom launcher i built.
This is also my first use of github and my first ever repository.
